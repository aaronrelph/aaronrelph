      <h1>Homepage</h1>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>The Fantex homepage needed a refresh after launching so we could more prominently feature our new commercial. Fantex being such a new concept to our audience they often did a lot of research before creating an account. Knowing this, our goal here was to design the conversion funnel around consuming content first and then driving them to sign up.</p>
      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>As the lead designer at Fantex my role was to take our new commercial and use it as the basis for a new homepage. I started by sketching concepts, knowing that we wanted to visually keep it clean and simple with a linear focus on the headline, viewing the commercial, and then the call-to-actions. Once I was comfortable with the sketches I prototyped a few explorations in Omnigraffle and started user experience testing. When testing we were mostly focused on the content, iterating until user could, at a glance, have an understanding of what fantex was and how they could learn more. All in all we conducted around 30 user interviews for this project. After working through the feedback I felt like we were in a good place to move into hi-fi comps and do one final round of UX tests just to make sure we hadn’t lost anything moving into color. From there I jumped into the browser writing the CSS, HTML, JS. Unfortunately this doesn’t live on Fantex.com anymore, but it does here.</p>

      <h1>Mobile Apps</h1>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Is was important that we gave traders the ability to buy and sell stock in all the ways they expected, one of which was on their phone. We started building this shortly after launching, working closely with an app dev firm in the UK. As the lead designer my role was to concept and design the app in full, work closely with the dev team to oversee development, manage the timeline, and conduct user interviews. From concept to app store live was about a 5 month project. </p>
      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>For this project we worked closely with an App Dev firm that had a lot of experience developing native finance apps. We had a team of 4 engineers and myself as lead designer on the team. I started by sketch concepts and working closely with the CEO and product lead on direction. Once the sketches were in a good place and we were all on the same page with a general idea of how we wanted the app to function I started prototyping. This is where we stated user testing too. The prototypes were rough, and lacked color but we wanted to get feedback fast and early so we focused on specific flows, like buying shares, and prototyped it, tested it with users, then iterated on it. By launch we ran at least 60 user experience interviews. Once we had the major flows prototyped and tested I moved into hi-fi comps. This was pretty quick since we were pulling the visual style from the website and most of the layout had already been set in when prototyping. Also around this time the engineers and I started working in sync. They had already begun work on the app based off prototypes but now it was time to start prepping assets, working on interactions, and getting everything to spec.</p>

    <div class="feature-main-content">
      <h1>On-boarding</h1>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Onboarding at Fantex was particularly complicated because of the all sensitive data we had to collect like ssn, investment history, etc, all for regulatory and tax purposes. Our goal here was to alleviate security concerns, reduce the number of steps,  and increase conversion through each step in the flow. </p>
      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>As the design lead at Fantex I started this project working closely with our regulatory team. We had to collect a lot of information and all the designs had to be approved by FINRA, a regulator of Fantex. Once we had a rough prototype approved I started running user experience interviews with current fantex clients and people that had never heard of us. After iterating on the feedback we had a solid 1 step signup process that most people felt comfortable completing. For those that didn’t feel comfortable we included a lot of learn more links and contact information to help alleviate those concerns. While testing I also moved into hi-fi comps so we could move a bit faster. That made it so once i was done interviewing users the hi-fi’s were basically done I was ready to start stubbing out the new flow in css, html, and js. Didn’t take long to ship after that.</p>
