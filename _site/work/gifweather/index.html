    <p>A weather app the shows you weather in your current location along with GIF in the background that is related to the current conditions.</p>
    <p>I started building this because I wanted to learn Swift. Pretty basic right now, but I learned a lot. </p>

      <h1>The App</h1>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>This is a side project I started working on so I could learn Swift, the basics anyway. iPhone weather apps are kinda the “Hello world” of apps for beginners. They’re everywhere. I wanted to make something visually simple that gave me a decent understanding of Swift but also challenging myself. My biggest challenges while coding this other than not knowing swift were working with the weather and giphy api’s to pull all the data, learning how to manage memory better with large images, and loading gif’s quickly so that app wasn’t hanging on a blank screen.</p>
      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>I got started by setting up my apple developer account, etc. I already knew some Xcode basics from working on another side project, AirBear, but also from working on other apps at Gumroad and Fantex. Now I needed to learn swift though and that’s where Treehouse came in. I tried a couple other sites for learning Swift and Treehouse was by far the best. Solid courses, really helpful, highly recommend for anyone just starting out. This got me most of the way but I needed to learn more about memory management and loading gifs quicker. Some of that was getting into more advanced swift courses but a lot of the help came from digging into CocoaPods where most of my problems were already solved. It’s still a work in progress but should launch soon! Follow along <a href="http://gifweather.co">here</a></p>
