      <h1>Analytics</h1>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Consumption analytics on Gumroad was one of the most powerful features we launched for creators while I was there. It gave creators a new insight into how their products were performing on a product and file level, whereas previously you were just making assumptions based off of the sales data. Now you can see which files in your best selling product are most popular and drill down even deeper to see the drop off rate for that song, video or book. It’s something no one else is really doing for all three verticals (music, video, and publishing).</p>
      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>As the design lead I started by researching how other content focused sites were handled analytics for their creators. Each had their own unique way of doing it but the big difference between us and them was they were focused on one vertical like film or music. We need to make a tool the worked across film, music, and publishing. With that in mind and research done I started sketching concepts. Once those were in a good spot I start on hi-fi comps and posting for feedback. After a couple rounds iterating on the design I was ready to get into the browser and start writing the CSS/HTML and a some JS. From there I paired with an engineer to get the backend wrapped up. Like most of the other features we worked on this was shipped atomic. Meaning we had the grand vision then we broke that up into smaller more manageable shipments. This result is fewer bugs, less code to PR each time, and shipping faster. </p>

      <h1>Reading</h1>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>The web <a href="http://blog.gumroad.com/post/112575479733/readingimprovements">reading experience</a> was one of the first projects I took on at Gumroad. It was the beginning of a shift in focus at Gumroad where previously we were focused on building the best selling experience for creators, now we also wanted to build a really great consumption experience for their audience. We had already done it with film, now it was time to do it with reading. Our goal was to build an experience for the web that was just as powerful as the experience in a native app like Kindle or iBooks. It’s mobile-friendly too.</p>
      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>As the design lead on this project we took this feature from concept to rollout in just under a month. I started with competitive research, collective everything I could find on Kindle, iBooks, and others that were in the same space. From there I started sketching concepts, with these I usually sketch what my best case would be. From there we had a good idea of what we wanted to build and which features we wanted to include, now it was time to design som hi-fi comps. After iterating two or three times we were in a good place to jump into the browser. From there I started stubbing out the html, css and js so everything was in a good place for the engineers. After that it was in their hands, aside from some light polish here and there.</p>

      <h1>Mobile App</h1>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>When I joined Gumroad we had just launched our first iPhone app, the Gumroad Library. Big props to Alex for that first version. Shortly after joining I led design going forward on feature support. Over my year at Gumroad we launched a new reading experience, better support for all products, new onboarding experience, an iPad app and so much more.</p>
      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>As the design lead for mobile apps I worked closely with our two mobile engineers, one focused on iOS and one on Android. New features usually mirrored what we were building for the web. Once I had the designs complete I’d export assets and import artboards into Zeplin. Zeplin was a lifesaver, for me and for the engineers. No more having to spec designs and engineers could easily access it all. After that we’d go through a round or two of polish, test it, and ship it.</p>

      <h1>Marketing</h1>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>One thing we did really well at Gumroad is ship features, a lot of them. One thing we needed to get better at was marketing the features that we created. Goal was to design a high level features page that included most everything Gumroad can do (it’s a lot) and also build out a couple landing pages focused on specific features.</p>
      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>As the design and front-end dev lead for this project my role was to create the content structure, design the UI, write the CSS/HTML and some of the JS. We knew we wanted a long scrolling page with a sticky nav that would link you to sections on the page so I skipped the sketching phase and jumped into designing hi-fi mocks. After a feedback round I’d gone through three iterations and we were in a good place to get into the browser. From there it was pretty straight forward, it’s all front-end work here so I wrapped that up, opened a PR, and shipped it.</p>

    <div class="feature-main">
      <h2>File library</h2>
      <p>Often creators have multiple products that share the same files. Rather than re-uploading every time, you're now able to upload once and have a library of files. Led design and front-end development.</p>

      <h2>Widgets</h2>
      <p>Maybe one of our most used features on Gumroad is the ability to <a href="https://gumroad.com/widgets">embed a product</a> on your website. My first project at Gumroad was to overhaul this page.  It’s a super simple tool to build a widget and get the code to make it work.</p>
