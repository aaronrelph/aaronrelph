Heyo, I’m Aaron, a product designer in San Francisco. I design with usability and simplicity in mind. I'm most interested in solving complex problems with unique solutions and building meaningful products that have a real impact on people’s lives. Currently I'm at [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com) helping creators earn a living doing that they love, [join us.](https://gumroad.com/jobs)

Previously I lead design at [Fantex](https://dribbble.com/aaronrelph/projects/207233-Fantex), a finance startup that lets you invest in a professional athletes brand. Prior to that I spent time at other ventures in healthcare, tech, education, and a ton of time freelancing. You should [say hi](mailto:aaron@imgonnarelph.com)!

<!-- I’m from Arizona. Born in Flagstaff, childhood in [Bagdad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagdad,_Arizona), and spent most of my life in Phoenix. It was hot, real hot. I started teaching myself design in 7th grade and have grown from there. I mumble sometime, and don’t like repeating myself. I spend my free time on side projects or traveling as much as my bank account will allow. -->

Occasionally i can be found [tweeting](http://www.twitter.com/aaronrelph), posting pixels to [dribbble](http://www.dribbble.com/aaronrelph) and [instagram](http://instagram.com/aaronrelph), code on [github](https://github.com/aaronrelph), and even [linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronrelph/) but I try and avoid that site as much as possible.
