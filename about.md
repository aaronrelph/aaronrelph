I’m Aaron, a product designer at Gumroad working to help creators make a living doing what they love. Join us.

![Aaron Relph](/aaron-relph-small.png "Aaron Relph")

Previously I’ve lead design at a Fianance/Sport startup, and spent time at other ventures in healthcare, tech, and so on.

I like food and drinks. Some people say i look like Rogger from the show Doug, i disagree. I mumble sometime, and I don’t like repeating myself.

I can be found occasionally tweeting or dribbling but usually not doing either of those.

Mostly i like to travel.
