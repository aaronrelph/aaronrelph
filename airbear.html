    <p>This is an app my buddy Jonathan and I built. He and his wife had just had their first child and needed an app to track feedings, so we built one.</p>
    <p>And the name AirBear was the nickname my mom gave me when i was a kid.. and maybe still calls me.</p>

      <h1>The App</h1>
      <p>Airbear is an app for new parents to log feedings. We started building this just after Jonathan and his wife had their first child. Something all new parents have to do is log feedings, whether it’s with pen and pad or in an app. We wanted to build something that was more than just a log of feedings, there are plenty of those apps. With AirBear we wanted something smarter that would learn from your activity and know when your next feeding should be, on which side, for how long and alert you when it’s time. There wasn’t anything like this. So we built AirBear.</p>
