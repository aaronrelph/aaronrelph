    <h2>GIF Weather</h2>
    <h4>Side Project</h4>
    <p><a href="http://gifweather.co">GIF Weather</a> is a weather app the pulls the temp along with a GIF based on to the current conditions. It’s pretty ridiculous. </p>
    <p>I started building this because I wanted to learn Swift. Pretty basic right now, but I learned a lot. </p>

      <h1>The App</h1>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>This is a little app I’m playing with to learn Swift. It’s a weather app the ties into the Giphy API and pulls a related GIF based on the current weather conditions. So if it’s “partly cloudy” it’ll pull a GIF based on that. Involved me learning some Swift, memory management, and figuring out how to work with the weather and Giphy API’s. It's not terribly pretty but it was fun to build.</p>
