  <p class="portfolio-lead">
    I’m a Product Designer based in San Francisco. Currently, I’m at <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> building tools the enable teams and organizations to work better, together. Previously I was designing at <a href="https://gumroad.com">Gumroad</a> helping creators to earn a living doing what they love.

    Outside of the GitHubs I make <a href="https://hallmonitor.co">Hall Monitor</a>, a product for monitoring your entire business in one place. For funs I spend my time woodworking, learning crafts like ceramics and leather work, hiking, brewing beer - things and stuff like that.
