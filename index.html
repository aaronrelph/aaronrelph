  <h1 class="post-title">Hi, I’m Aaron.</h1>

  <p>I design things. Things that you see on the internet and on your phone. Sometimes I do other things.</p>
  <p>Currently I’m a Product Designer at <a href="https://gumroad.com">Gumroad</a>. We’re building a company that helps creators earn a living doing what they love. It’s amazing, you should <a href="https://gumroad.com/jobs">join</a>. Previously did other things.</p>
  <p>I can be found occasionally <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronrelph">tweeting</a> words, posting pixels to <a href="https://dribbble.com/aaronrelph">dribbble</a> or <a href="https://instagram.com/aaronrelph/">instagram</a>, and code to <a href="https://github.com/aaronrelph">github</a>.</p>
  <p>That's me.</p>
