    Iâ€™m a Product Designer based in San Francisco. Currently, Iâ€™m at <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>
    building dev tools. Previously I was designing at <a href="https://gumroad.com">Gumroad</a> and before that other
    places.

  <p class="prose">
    Outside of GitHub I makeÂ things like <a href="https://hallmonitor.co">Hall Monitor</a>, an analytics tool for small
    businesses, and run a small batch handmade goods shop called <a href="https://jerksto.re">Jerk
      Store</a> (coming soon) that focuses on my woodworking and leathercraft.
