    <p class="p-large">
      I'm Aaron, a product designer and front-end developer based in San Francisco. Currently I’m at <a href="/">Sisu</a> building a data analytics product. Previsouly I spent 4 years building developer tools at <a href="">GitHub</a> where I led design for the enterprise products.
    </p>
    <p class="p-large">
      My approach is often fast paced and pragmatic. I try to be as direct and honest as possible. I'm someone who can operate independently on complex problems moving thoughtfully and efficiently through iterations to shipped product. A generalist by nature I often touch all aspects of a project from research and product development to design and implementation.
