<div class="home">

  <h1 class="post-title">Journal</h1>

  <p>Trying something new here, hopefully it sticks. I want to start writing more with a goal of atleast once a month. Topics will vary but mostly it’ll be travel and design related. It’s just a way of getting my thoughts down, organizing them. Most of it will probably be nonsense. </p>

  <ul class="post-list">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
      <li>
        <span class="post-meta">{{ post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span>

        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
        </h2>
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>

</div>
