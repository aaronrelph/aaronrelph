      <h1>Analytics</h1>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>The Audience Dashboard on Gumroad is an overview of audience growth and product consumption. Our goal was to give creators a new insight into how their products were performing. With <a href="http://blog.gumroad.com/post/129867141653/consumptionanalytics">consumption analytics</a> creators could now see which files were most read, watched, or listened too and drill down even deeper to see the drop off rate for that song, video or book. Here are <a href="http://blog.gumroad.com/post/130292059358/feedbackloop">some learnings</a>.</p>

      <h1>Reading</h1>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>The web <a href="http://blog.gumroad.com/post/112575479733/readingimprovements">reading experience</a> was one of the first projects I took on at Gumroad. It was the beginning of a shift in focus at Gumroad where previously we were focused on building the best selling experience for creators, now we also wanted to build a really great consumption experience for their audience. We had already done it with film, now it was time to do it with reading. Our goal was to build an experience for the web that was just as powerful as the experience in a native app like Kindle or iBooks. It’s mobile-friendly too.</p>

      <h1>Mobile App</h1>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>When I joined Gumroad we had just launched our first iPhone app, the Gumroad Library. Big props to Alex for that first version. Shortly after joining I led design going forward on feature support. Over my year at Gumroad we launched a new reading experience, better support for all products, new onboarding experience, an iPad app and so much more.</p>

      <h1>Marketing</h1>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>One thing we did really well at Gumroad is ship features, a lot of them. One thing we needed to get better at was marketing the features that we created. Goal was to design a high level features page that included most everything Gumroad can do (it’s a lot) and also build out a couple landing pages focused on specific features.</p>

      <h1>The Others</h1>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Aside from the big feature launches mentioned above we shipped a ton of others, a few that I’ll mention here real quick.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-main">
      <h2>File library</h2>
      <p>Often creators have multiple products that share the same files. Rather than re-uploading every time, you're now able to upload once and have a library of files. Led design and front-end development.</p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-main">
      <h2>Widgets</h2>
      <p>Maybe one of our most used features on Gumroad is the ability to <a href="https://gumroad.com/widgets">embed a product</a> on your website. My first project at Gumroad was to overhaul this page.  It’s a super simple tool to build a widget and get the code to make it work.</p>

    <div class="feature-main">
      <h2>Rentals</h2>
      <p>Filmmakers had requested this for awhile. Previously you only had the option to sell and make it stream only. Now you set a rental option and the product would expire after a period of time. </p>
